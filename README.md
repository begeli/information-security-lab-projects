# Information Security Lab Projects
* This lab introduces some technical tools that are available when doing security by design, such as:
  Cryptographic implementation; protocols for authentication and
  secure communications; formal modelling and proofs of security in the
  computational setting.
* It aims to teach adversarial thinking:
  Be skeptical about everything you are told about how a system works,
  analyse the system components individually and in concert, find the
  hidden dependencies between the components, and find non-obvious
  crucial system components.

## Modules 
* **Module 1:** Implementation of eliptic curve cryptography (ECC) primitives, and cryptanalysis of ECC with fully and partially leaked nonces 
* **Module 2:** Implementation SIGMA protocol, implementation of TLS 1.3 protocol with PSKs and session resumption
* **Module 3:** Cryptographic reductions
* **Module 4:** Exploitation of Trusted Execution Environments
* **Module 5:** Runtime attacks

Detailed explanations of each task can be found in the PDFs inside the module folders.
